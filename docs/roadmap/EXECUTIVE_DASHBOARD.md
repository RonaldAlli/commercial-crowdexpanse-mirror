# Volume 10 — Executive Dashboard

> The single source of truth for "what state is each module in." Update this table whenever a module's status changes (part of the [Definition of Done](./ENGINEERING_MASTER_PLAN.md#definition-of-done)).
> **Last reviewed:** 2026-07-12. Percentages are engineering-judgment estimates of scope-complete against that module's roadmap.

¹ Backup/restore tooling is complete in code and documentation (six-stage pipeline, verified restore drill). Two **operational** follow-ups remain and are intentionally outside the codebase: provisioning the Cloudflare R2 bucket + credentials, and enabling the documented cron schedule. Until both are done, runs report 5/6 (off-site mirror pending).

## Release progress

| Version | Theme | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1.0 | Foundation | ✅ Shipped |
| 1.1 | Operational Excellence | 🟡 ~88% (testing/CI/lists + D4 backups + permissions Slices 1–2 done; team/invite lifecycle + performance remain) |
| 1.2 | Commercial Intelligence | 🔴 Planned |
| 1.3 | Commercial Underwriting | 🟡 Foundation (~35%) |
| 1.4 | Closing Center | 🔴 Planned |
| 2.0 | Automation & AI | 🔴 Planned |

## Development workflow (every feature)

```
Roadmap → Architecture → Specification → Implementation → Testing → Documentation → Merge → Release
```
Nothing skips a step. See the [EMP lifecycle](./ENGINEERING_MASTER_PLAN.md#development-lifecycle).

## Top priorities right now
1. **1.1 Team Management + Invitations lifecycle (highest-priority engineering task):** member deactivation/removal, org settings, and invitation email delivery/resend/expiry UX. (Permissions Slices 1–2 are complete — enforced + audited across all write actions.)
2. **1.1 Testing depth:** unit tests for pure `lib/*`; lint in CI.
3. **1.1 Performance:** latency budgets for board + search; index review.

**Operational follow-ups (not engineering code — see [Operations → Backups](./OPERATIONS_ROADMAP.md)):** provision Cloudflare R2 bucket/credentials, store the backup passphrase off-host, and enable the documented cron schedule. (D4 backup/restore tooling itself is ✅ complete.)

## How to update this dashboard
- Change a module's Status/% when its roadmap scope moves (same PR as the change).
- Keep this table and [Module Roadmaps](./MODULE_ROADMAPS.md) consistent — they must never disagree.
- Re-review the whole table at the start of each release.
